It is part of the: [IBMStockTrader Java EE Portfolio Implementation](https://github.com/IBMStockTrader/portfolio/blob/master/src/main/java/com/ibm/hybrid/cloud/sample/stocktrader/portfolio/json/Portfolio.java).

In our new project, the Portfolio will be split up into a separate "Portfolio" and "Account" Microservice.
The Account will keep all the information that is not of interest to the portfolio like balance details and broker related information.
